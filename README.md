# Retrieval-Augmented Generation Q&A using Telegram Bot

This project is a Q&A system that uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach to answer questions. The system retrieves relevant documents from a database using a vector similarity search algorithm and generates an answer based on the retrieved documents and the original question. The Q&A system is deployed as a Telegram bot that can be used to ask questions and receive answers.

## Requirements

To use this Q&A system, you will need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- The packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- A Telegram account and an API token for a Telegram bot (see the [Telegram documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) for instructions on how to create a bot and obtain an API token)
- A database of documents in plain text format

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Before using the Q&A system, you will need to configure the following settings:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for document embeddings)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot API token
- `DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY`: The path to the directory containing the documents

These settings can be configured by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project directory with the following contents:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=INSERT_YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY=/path/to/documents
```

Replace `INSERT_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` and `INSERT_YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key and Telegram bot API token, respectively. Replace `/path/to/documents` with the actual path to the directory containing your documents.

## Usage

To start the Telegram bot, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the Telegram bot and listen for incoming messages. To ask a question, send a message to the bot with the question text. The bot will retrieve relevant documents from the database and generate an answer based on the retrieved documents and the original question.
